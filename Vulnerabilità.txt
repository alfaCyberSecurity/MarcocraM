Apache Camel Netty enables Java deserialization by default. Apache Camel 2.22.x, 2.23.x, 2.24.x, 2.25.0, 3.0.0 up to 3.1.0 are affected. 2.x users should upgrade to 2.25.1, 3.x users should upgrade to 3.2.0.

Apache Camel's File is vulnerable to directory traversal. Camel 2.21.0 to 2.21.3, 2.22.0 to 2.22.2, 2.23.0 and the unsupported Camel 2.x (2.19 and earlier) versions may be also affected.

Apache Camel prior to 2.24.0 contains an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability (CWE-611) due to using an outdated vulnerable JSON-lib library. This affects only the camel-xmljson component, which was removed.

Apache Camel's Validation Component is vulnerable against SSRF via remote DTDs and XXE.
